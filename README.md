## Coroutine Basics

- CoroutineScope and launch: Basic usage of CoroutineScope and launch to start a coroutine.
- Delay: Using delay to suspend coroutine execution for a specified amount of time.
- GlobalScope and async: Using GlobalScope and async to perform asynchronous computation and retrieve the result with await.
- runBlocking: Running a blocking coroutine using runBlocking.

## Asynchronous Operations

- Dispatchers: Specifying different dispatchers for coroutines (Dispatchers.Main, Dispatchers.IO, Dispatchers.Default).
- Performing Network Request: Making a network request asynchronously using coroutines and URL.
- Using withContext: Using withContext to switch the coroutine context for a specific block of code.
- SupervisorJob: Using SupervisorJob to supervise child coroutines and handle failures.

## Flows

- Creating Flows: Creating flows using flow builder function and emitting values.
- Transforming Flows: Transforming flows using map and filter.
- Collecting Flows: Collecting values emitted by flows using collect.
- Flow Operators: Demonstrating various flow operators like flowOn for changing the context where the flow is executed.

## Channels

- Channel Basics: Basic usage of channels for communication between coroutines.
- Sending and Receiving: Sending and receiving data through channels using send and receive.
- Ticker Channel: Using ticker channel for emitting values at specified intervals.

## Conclusion

These examples provide a starting point for understanding and using Kotlin coroutines effectively in your applications. Experiment with these examples and explore further to harness the full power of coroutines for writing asynchronous code.
